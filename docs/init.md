# Initialize your project

APEX Nitro needs to know a few things before connecting your APEX app.

To initialize an APEX Nitro project, go to the directory where your files (JavaScript, CSS, other) will be.

```bash
cd /myprojectpath/
```

Our directory is currently empty:

```bash
|-/myprojectpath/
```

Execute the following command and a series of questions will be asked:

```bash
apex-nitro init
```

## Choosing a mode

When you run `apex-nitro init`, the first question is "Pick a mode" and you will be asked to choose between Basic and Pro.

- Basic mode is recommended for first time users as it a really simple way to get started
- Pro mode is recommended for the best experience and the best performance

After choosing a mode, the following questions will depend on the mode you picked.

## Creating the `apexnitro.config.json` file

After running `apex-nitro init`, our directory now contains a project configuration file:

```bash
|-/myprojectpath/
  |-apexnitro.config.json
```

The answers to the questions from `apex-nitro init` are saved to a file called `apexnitro.config.json` in the same directory as `apex-nitro init` was run. The content of `apexnitro.config.json` are the properties for your APEX Nitro project and it drives your APEX Nitro experience.

## Modifying your `apexnitro.config.json` file

If you wish to make modifications to your APEX Nitro project configuration, you can either:

1. Execute `apex-nitro init` again and overwrite current configuration.
1. Edit the project `apexnitro.config.json` file and make the changes needed.
